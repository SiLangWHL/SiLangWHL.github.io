## About Me
I am a first-year Ph.D. candidate at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology  (HongKong, China), advised by Prof. [Xiaomeng Li](https://xmengli.github.io/). Before that, I received my M.S. degrees from Zhejiang University (Hangzhou, China) in 2022, advised by Prof. [Haoji Hu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/huhaoji).

I am interested in a variety of topics in computer vision and medical image processing.
