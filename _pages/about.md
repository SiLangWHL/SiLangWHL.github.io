## About Me
I am a 1st-year Ph.D. candidate at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology  (HongKong, China), advised by Prof. [Xiaomeng Li](https://xmengli.github.io/). Before that, I received my M.S. degrees from Zhejiang University (Hangzhou, China) in 2022, advised by Prof. [Haoji Hu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/huhaoji).

I am interested in a variety of topics in computer vision and medical image processing.


## News
- 2022/07: Two papers accepted by ECCV'22. 
  - One about efficient deep learning (neural network pruning). We present the first filter pruning method that effectively maintains trainability during pruning *and* scales to large-scale deep neural networks. Code will be released <a href="https://github.com/MingSun-Tse/TPP">here</a>.
  - The other about efficient novel view synthesis: R2L, *the first* residual MLP network to represent **neural light field (NeLF)** for efficient novel view synthesis. Check our <a href="https://snap-research.github.io/R2L/">webpage</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.17261">arxiv</a>!
- 2022/04: We offer *the very first* survey paper on **Pruning at Initialization**, accepted by IJCAI'22 [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.06460">Arxiv</a>] [<a href="https://github.com/MingSun-Tse/Awesome-Pruning-at-Initialization">Paper Collection</a>].
