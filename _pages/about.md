## About Me
I am a first-year Ph.D. candidate at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HongKong, China), advised by Prof. [Xiaomeng Li](https://xmengli.github.io/). Before that, I was lucky enough to be advised by Prof. [Haoji Hu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/huhaoji) and Prof. [Zuozhu Liu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/lzz) at Zhejiang University (Hangzhou, China), and received my M.S. degree in 2022.

I am interested in a variety of topics in computer vision and medical image processing.
